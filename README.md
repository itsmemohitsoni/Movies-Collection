# Movies-Collection
    ->Made by Mohit Soni

->  Introduction
      The "Movie Collection" project is a software application developed using object-oriented programming principles and implemented in C++. The purpose of this  
      project is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing a collection of movies. Users can add, edit, and delete movies from their collection, as well as
      search for specific movies based on different criteria.
    
->  Objectives
      The main objectives of the "Movie Collection" project are as follows:
      *  To create a user-friendly interface for managing a movie collection.
      *  To implement object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance.
      *  To provide functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting movies.
      *  To allow users to search for movies based on various criteria such as title, genre, or release year.

->  The "Movie Collection" folder consists of three files- 
      "Movie.h"  -> It is the header file consisting the information of the class, its objects, its methods 
      "Movie.cpp" -> This is the compilable file which contains the description of constructor, other functions
      "main.cpp:  -> This is the main file using the  "Movie.h" header file and the database is accessed and manipulated using this file

->  Using this program one can :- 
    1.  Access the database and data stored in it
    2.  Change the data stored in the database
    3.  Upload data accordingly to the database
    4.  Search any particular information in the database
    5.  Delete the database and manipulate it accordingly

-> To compile the program, download the code and compile it using the command "g++ main.cpp Movie.cpp", then open the executable file generated and use the program

->  By implementing the "Movie Collection" project, users can conveniently manage their movie collections. This project serves as an excellent example of applying
    object-oriented programming concepts in real-world scenarios.
